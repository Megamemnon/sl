  SL is a formal language together with a program for verifying proofs. Both
  the verifier and the database of proofs are works in progress. Currently,
  the database has the axioms of propositional logic, first-order logic (with
  equality), and ZF, with some basic theorems proved from these axioms. Right
  now, the goal is to construct the natural numbers and their arithmetic within
  set theory.
